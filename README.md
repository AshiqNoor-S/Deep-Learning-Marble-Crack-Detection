# Deep Learning: Marble Crack Detection

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for my deep learning capstone project, where I applied deep learning techniques to address the challenge of crack detection in marble images. I implemented two models, one using VGG16 and the other using ResNet50, and compared their performance.

## Project Structure

- **`Data/`**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- **`Notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model development, and evaluation.
- **`Models/`**: Saved model files after training.
- **`Comparison and Testing/`**: Results and performance metrics.

## Libraries Used

- **Keras**: Used for building and training deep learning models.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for data visualization and plotting.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations and array manipulation.
- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **os**: Used for interacting with the operating system.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure the dataset is in the `data/` directory.

2. **Model Training**: Use the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to train the VGG16 and ResNet50 models.

3. **Evaluation**: View the model performance metrics in the `results/` directory.

## Model Performance

### VGG16 Performance

- Accuracy: 99.57%
- Loss: 0.01698

### ResNet50 Performance

- Accuracy: 99.94%
- Loss: 0.00302
